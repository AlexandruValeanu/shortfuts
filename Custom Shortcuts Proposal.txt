- Replace "Native" and "Legacy" with new, single mode
- Store a map (represented as object) of keyCode => shortcut, where shortcut is an enum
- Implement a keydown listener that takes keyCode and searches map
  - If keyCode results in a hit, pass to another function that'll have a switch
    on that and call appropriate function from provider
- Have UI to edit shortcuts
  - UI would have a Save and a Discard option
  - Save would build the map with whatever were in the inputs (just overwrite)
  - Before writing to storage, there'd have to be a validator that ensures
    there are no duplicates
    - If there dupes, just show an error message and let them sort it out
  - UI should have button to restore default shortcuts
- Update FAQ
- For navigation shortcuts (back, prev item, etc.), we'll also listen for defaults.
